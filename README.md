# Simple Blog Application

Simple Blog is a .NET Core 7 application built using Entity Framework as the ORM. The application follows the hexagonal architecture, CQRS, and SOLID design principles. It includes six main methods including create, update, list, make post available, and swagger.

The application uses PostgreSQL as its database and can be easily deployed using Docker Compose. It also comes with simple tests to ensure its functionality.

This repository serves as a showcase of my programming skills and can also serve as a foundation for anyone looking to build a similar blog application.
